# Archive (2026-02-10)

This folder preserves superseded planning documents and snapshots while the repo is being “greenfielded”.

Principles:
- Do not edit archived files in place.
- Prefer creating new living docs under `planning/` and stable specs under `docs/`.
- If an archived artifact needs an update, make a new version elsewhere and link to it.

Contents:
- `plan_legacy.md` — previous normalization plan (archived).
- `dmm_prd_wbs_legacy.md` — previous PRD/WBS (archived).
