# Docs (specs)

This directory contains stable-ish documentation that keeps the repo organized:
- repo structure and “what goes where”
- ID policy and stability rules
- data model / table definitions
- TEI / standoff mapping conventions
- validation expectations (especially IIIF vs TEI coverage)
- Phase 1 citation schema + normalization rules

Living execution tracking lives in `planning/`.
