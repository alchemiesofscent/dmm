<p id="p-27">PREFACE</p>
<p id="p-28">THE great work compiled during the first century A.D. by DIOSCORIDES
of Anazarba in Cilicia has been the chief source whence, for fifteen
centuries and more, herbalists of all nations have drawn their
inspiration, yet no English translation has hitherto been published.</p>
<p id="p-29">The first English writer to realize the importance of rendering this
fountain-head of medical and botanical knowledge available for his
fellow-countrymen was JOHN GOODYER, the great Botanist of Petersfield.
Between the years 1652 and 1655 he laboriously wrote out the entire
Greek text with an interlinear English translation on 4,540 quarto
pages; and this, so far as I am aware, is the one and only attempt at an
English Dioscorides.</p>
<p id="p-30">Even as Philemon Holland is worthy of the highest praise for having
had the courage to translate the works of the elder Pliny, and so to
cause him, with his natural curiosities, to live again for the
delectation of Englishmen in the seventeenth century, so the translation
of John Goodyer does reflect the extent to which the Dioscoridean
<hi rend="italic">Materia Medica</hi> might have been
available to such Elizabethan and Jacobean Herbalists—as Gerard,
Parkinson, and others. It is therefore a source of the first importance
from the point of view of the History of the English Herbal.</p>
<p id="p-31">Goodyer’s work was never printed. Perhaps he failed to find a patron
such as Holland’s Sir Robert Cecil; and in his day ‘to set foot forward
in forreine ground without the countenance of some worthie personage’
was too ‘fearefull’ a risk for a publisher. But whatever the cause of
its non-appearance by 1664, Goodyer’s manuscript translation, with his
fine botanical library, came to Magdalen College. For centuries it has
remained unnoticed and unused by generations of classical tutors who, in
lectures on the classics, have preached the sterile joys of reading dead
languages in the original, rather than the duty of making the contained
information available to their fellow-countrymen.</p>
<p id="p-32">The justification for the present and largely uncorrected edition of
Goodyer’s translation is that it reproduces the atmosphere of his style,
that it is a valuable historical document, and that it may still
stimulate the curious to sift the indigenous from the exotic, and to
discover the sources of much fictitious matter. While certain needful
changes have been made in punctuation and order of words to make their
meaning clearer, no drastic attempt has been made to alter the spelling,
or even to make it uniform or to accord with nineteenth-century
practice.</p>
<p id="p-33">If our text presents a Greek work of the first century as understood
in Hampshire in the sixteenth century, the illustrations have yet higher
interest. They are the work of a Byzantine artist of about A.D. 512, for
presentation to Juliana Anicia, daughter of Anicius Olybrius, Emperor of
the West in 472. And although I cannot quite assume with my friend Dr.
Singer that the Byzantine artist was incapable of faithfully
representing living plants, save by making slavish copies from older
drawings, there is good internal evidence that he did as a matter of
fact base his drawings upon originals that were not far removed from
sketches by the famous CRATEUAS, whose plant-descriptions are
occasionally quoted in the text. Pliny, who was well acquainted with the
technical difficulties, mentions several Greek artists who had made the
attempt of illustrating floras, but he did not write very
enthusiastically about their success.</p>
<p id="p-34">They painted every herb in their colours, and under their portraits
they couched and subscribed their several natures and effects. But what
certainly could there be therein? pictures, you know, are deceitfull;
also, in representing such a number of colours, and especially
representing the lively hew of Hearbs according to their nature as they
grow, no marvell if they that limned and drew them out, did fail and
degenerat from the first pattern and originall. Besides they came far
short of the mark, setting out hearbs as they did at one only season (to
wit, either in their floure, or in seed-time) for they change and alter
their form and shape every quarter of the yeare.</p>
<p id="p-35">Crateuas, however, was among those whom he considered worthy of
special mention for having written on Herbs in a most pleasant and
plausible manner. He was a rhizotomist as well as an author. He had had
the advantage of being body physician to Mithridates VI Eupator (120-63
B.C.), the most enlightened ruler of Pontus, who described the plants of
his kingdom by his own hand,<note n="1" id="ftn-1"/>
and who had the reputation of knowing more about poisons and their
antidotes than any one else in his day: that most potent antidote, the
<hi rend="italic">mithridate</hi>, preserved his name all
through the Middle Ages.</p>
<p id="p-36">The illustrated work of Crateuas was of first-rate significance in
the history of botany, for it is reported to have comprised the most
life-like pictures of plants drawn at that time. So skilful was he that
he has been justly called the ‘father of plant illustration’. And, it is
remarkable that the best of the Anician drawings are just those which
are associated with explanatory texts containing quotations from
Crateuas.</p>
<p id="p-37">Dr. Singer has indicated eleven figures of plants, as presumably by
Crateuas; and they have been identified by Mr. A.J. Wilmott as
<hi rend="italic">Asarum europaeum</hi> (1.9);
<hi rend="italic">Plantago sp.</hi> (2.153);
<hi rend="italic">Asphodelus sp.</hi> (2.199);
<hi rend="italic">Papaver dubium</hi>
(2.207);<note n="2" id="ftn-2"/>
<hi rend="italic">Adonis aestivalis</hi> (2.208);
<hi rend="italic">Anagallis arvensis</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
<hi rend="italic">foemina</hi> (2.209);
<hi rend="italic">Aristolochia pallida</hi> (3.4);
<hi rend="italic">Aristolochia sempervirens</hi> (3.5);
<hi rend="italic">Salvia multifida</hi>
(4.36);<note n="2" id="ftn-3"/>
<hi rend="italic">Silene linifolia</hi>
(4.120.)<note n="2" id="ftn-4"/> In addition to these,
though nos. 2.154 and 4.35 are doubtful, the merit of the figure of
<hi rend="italic">Thlaspi Bursapastoris</hi> (2.186) is
excellent, as too are many of the other figures, some of which have
evidently got attached to the wrong descriptions, e.g.
<hi rend="italic">Moly</hi> (3.54). Yet another of the
plants of Crateuas is specially mentioned by
Pliny,<note n="3" id="ftn-5"/> and for the sake of
completeness we may quote Holland’s translation here.</p>
<p id="p-38">ALIMON. Crateuas hath made mention of a third sort, which hath longer
leaves than the rest, and more rough in the hand, in smell resembling
the Cipres tree; who saith that it delighteth to grow principally under
the Yvie tree; which if it be taken to the weight of 3 oboli in a sextar
of water, helpeth those that have their heads and bodies drawn far back,
and such as are troubled with the contraction and shrinking of
sinews.</p>
<p id="p-39">This may or may not be the ‘Alimos’ of Dioscorides, i.20.</p>
<p id="p-40">Many of the figures seem hopeless of interpretation. Nevertheless, we
have printed them, in the hope that field-botanists when travelling in
the special localities whence the Dioscoridean flora was derived, may
this recognize a few of the plants which through mistaken features it
has been impossible to identify in a herbarium of dried plants.</p>
<p id="p-41">The specific names with which we have headed every chapter are
perhaps less justifiable.</p>
<p id="p-42">In the present state of uncertainty we have thought it better to
abstain from adding to the long lists of suggested synonyms which have
been proposed, and to quote names from the list of identifications
appended by Charles Daubeny to his ‘Lectures on Roman Husbandry’ 1857,
and reprinted with a few corrections as an appendix to this book on page
600. In other cases the names suggested have been derived from
Sprengel’s edition of Dioscorides. The Labiate and Composite
identifications have been revised by Mr. E. Baker and by Messrs. H.W.
Pugsley and Cecil Norman respectively. Unfortunately in many cases the
plant described is apparently not the same as the plant figured, so the
name quoted may apply to either one or the other, but not to both.
Still, if these imperfect identifications stimulate by their falsity the
production of a revised version, they will not have been printed in
vain.</p>
<p id="p-43">I desire here to make mention of the great loss which such historical
studies as these have suffered through the recent death of Dr. Otto
Stapf of Kew. For many years he had had the intention to publish an
account of the Dioscoridean flora, but what with the abundance of its
insoluble problems, and with pressure of other work, he was never able
to find the time to go as fully into the matter as he considered
necessary. Death has robbed Botany of an invaluable coadjutor.</p>
<p id="p-44">A few words must also be added in acknowledgement of help received
from the Librarians of Magdalen College and of the Royal College of
Physicians for the continued loan of the Goodyer Manuscript and of
Sprengel’s edition of Dioscorides. Also our thanks to Mr. Sprague of Kew
for the identification of three species of plants, and especially to
Miss F.A. Boustead, who with great skill and patience has made the
admirable copies of the drawings in the Vienna Codex, with which this
book is illustrated, and without which it would not have been printed
to-day.</p>
<p id="p-45">The text of the book was set up at the University Press in Oxford,
but, where the figures are numerous, was reproduced with them by the
Replika process, executed by Messrs. Lund Humphries &amp; Co. at
Bradford. The scale by which the figures have been reduced may be
estimated by the size of the accompanying captions: it varies with the
space available on each page.</p>

<p id="p-63">Of Pedacius Dioscorides, of Medicinall matter, the first Booke</p>
<p id="p-64">Engl. 27 Apr. 1652 h. 10 a.</p>
<p id="p-65">Graec. 29 Aug. 1655 ho. 2 p.</p>
<p id="p-66">DEAREST AREIUS,</p>
<p id="p-67">Although many writers of modern times, as well as of antiquity, have
composed Treatises on the preparation, power and testing of medicines, I
will try to show you that I was not moved to this undertaking by any
vain or senseless impulse. It was because some of these authors did not
perfect their work, while others derived most of their account from
histories. IOLAS the Bithynian and HEXACLIDES the Tarentine did indeed
slightly touch upon the subject, but they entirely omitted the Treatise
on Herbs, and failed to record all metallics and spices. CRATEUAS, the
rhizotomist, and ANDREAS, the physician, appear to have been better
versed in this part of the subject than the others, but have passed over
many very serviceable roots and have given insufficient descriptions of
several herbs. Yet it must be confessed that though the matters, which
they have transmitted, are few, yet the ancients have used great
diligence in their work.</p>
<p id="p-68">We may not be wholly in agreement with the modern writers, among whom
are JULIUS BASSUS, NICERATUS and PETRONIUS, NIGER and DIODOTUS, all
Asclepiads. They have in a manner deigned to describe familiar facts
well-known to all, but they have transmitted the powers of Medicines and
their examination cursorily, not estimating their efficacy by
experience, but by vain prating about the cause, have lifted up each
medicine to a heap of controversy: and besides this they have recorded
one thing by mistake for another. Thus NIGER, who seems to be a man of
special note amongst them, states that Euphorbion is the juice of
Chamelaia growing in Italy, that Androsaimon is the same as Hypericon,
and that Aloe is a mineral growing in Judaea, and in the face of plain
evidence he sets down many more such falsehoods, which are tokens that
he acquired his information not by his own observation, but had it only
from the false relation of hearsay. Moreover, they have offended in the
classification of medicines: some couple together those of quite
contrary faculties, others follow an alphabetical arrangement in their
writing, and have separated both the kinds and the operations of things
that are closely related, so that thereby they come to be harder to
remember.</p>
<p id="p-69">But we, as I may say from our first growth, having an unceasing
desire to acquire knowledge of this matter, and having travelled much
(for you know that I led a soldier’s life), have by your advice gathered
together all that I have commented hereupon, and have committed it into
five books. This compilation I dedicate to you, thus fulfilling my
grateful affection for the goodwill you have towards us. It is your
nature to show yourself a familiar friend to all who are led by
learning, but especially to those who follow the same profession, and
yet more particularly to myself. But the great affection that that most
excellent man, LICINIUS BASSUS (doth bear) unto thee, is no small token
of the lovable goodness that is in thee, which I know, beholding when I
lived with you, the goodwill worthy of emulation, that passed between
you both.</p>
<p id="p-70">But I beg that you, and all who may peruse these Commentaries, will
not pay attention so much to the force of our words, as to the industry
and experience (that I have brought to bear in the matter. For with very
accurate diligence, knowing most herbs with mine own eyes, others by
Historical relation agreeable to all, and by questioning, diligently
enquiring of the Inhabitants of each sort, we will endeavour both to
make use of another arrangement, and also to describe the kinds of
forces of every one of them.</p>
<p id="p-71">Now it is obvious to everybody that a Treatise on Medicines is
necessary, for it is conjoined to the whole Art of Healing, and by
itself yields a mighty assistance to every part. And because its scope
may be enlarged both in the direction of methods of preparation, and of
mixtures, and of experiments on diseases and because a knowledge of each
separate medicine contributes much hereunto, we will include matter that
is familiar and closely allied, that the book may be complete.</p>
<p id="p-72">Before all else it is proper to use care both in the storing up and
in the gathering of herbs each at its due season, for it is according to
this that medicines either do their work, or become quite ineffectual.
We ought to gather herbs when the weather is clear, for there is a great
difference whether it be dry or rainy when the gathering is made. The
place also makes a difference: whether the localities be mountainous and
high, whether they lie open to the wind, whether they be cold and dry;
upon this the stronger forces of drugs depend. Medicinal plants found
growing on plains, in plashy and shady localities, where the wind cannot
blow through, are for the most part the weaker; and especially those
that are not gathered at the right season, or else are decayed through
weakness. It must also not be forgotten that herbs frequently ripen
earlier or later according to the characteristics of the country and the
temperature of the year, and that while some of them by an innate
property bear flowers and leaves in winter, others flower twice in a
year. Now it behoves anyone who desires to be a skilful herbalist, to be
present when the plants first shoot out of the earth, when they are
fully grown, and when they begin to fade. For he who is only present at
the budding of the herb, cannot know it when full-grown, nor can he who
hath examined a full-grown herb, recognize it when it has only just
appeared above ground. Owing to changes in the shape of leaves and the
size of stalks, and of the flowers and fruits, and of certain other
known characteristics, a great mistake has been made by some who have
not paid proper attention to them in this manner. For this very reason,
some authors have blundered when they have written of some plants that
they bear neither flowers, nor stalk, nor fruit, citing Gramen,
Tussilago and Quinquefolium. Therefore the man who will observe his
herbs oftentimes and in divers places, will acquire the greatest
knowledge of them. We must likewise be aware that only those Medicinal
Herbs, the White and Black Hellebore,
<hi rend="italic">Veratrum album</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">niger</hi>, retain their power for many
years; the others, for the most part, will only keep good for use for
three years. But herbs which are full of branches, like Stoechas,
Chamaidrus, Polion, Abrotonum, Seriphium, Absinthium, Hyssopum, and the
like should be gathered whilst they are great with seed; flowers ought
to be gathered before they fall; fruits when they are ripe, and seeds
when they begin to be dry, and before they fall out. To extract the
juice of herbs, take their stalks when they have newly sprouted; and so
too with the leaves. But for taking juices and tears, the stems should
be cut while yet in their ripeness. Roots for storing or for the
extraction of juices and the peeling of barks, should be collected when
the herbs are beginning to lost their leaves, when those which are clean
may be set to dry forthwith in dry places, but those which have earth or
clay sticking to them must be washed with water. Flowers and
sweet-scented things should be laid up in dry boxes of Lime-wood: but
there are some herbs which do well enough it wrapped up in papers or
leaves for the preservation of their seeds. For moist medicines some
thicker material such as silver, or glass, or horn will agree best. Yes,
and earthenware if it be not thin is fitting enough, and so is wood,
particularly if it be box-wood. Vessels of brass will be suitable for
eye-medicines and for liquids and for all that are compounded of vinegar
or of liquid pitch or of Cedria, but fats and marros ought to be put up
in vessels of tin.</p>

but it beares leaves like unto a little sword but greater &amp; broader
&amp; fatter [or thicker]: the flowers on the stalke, are bended in, one
over against another, &amp; divers, for they are either soon white or
pale or black or purple or azure. Whence for the varietie of colours it
is likened to the heavenly rainebow. The rootes under are knotty, strong
[or sound], of a sweet savour, which after the cutting ought to be dryed
in the shade, &amp; soe (with a linnen thread put through them) to be
layd up. But ye best is that of Illyria &amp; Macedonia, &amp; of these
the best is that which hath a thick roote, stumped, &amp; hard to
breake, &amp; in color of a faint-yellow, &amp; exceeding well-scenting,
&amp; very bitter to the tast, of a sound smell, &amp; not enclining to
nastinesse, &amp; moving to sneesing in ye beating. The second is that
of Lybia, [or Africa] white according to the colour, bitter according to
the tast, next in strength (to the former), but when they grow old they
will be worm-eaten, yet then they smell the sweeter. But all of them
have a warming, extenuating facultie, fitting against coughs, &amp;
extenuating grosse humors hard to get up. They purge thick humors &amp;
choler, being dranck in Hydromel to the quantity of seven dragms they
are also causers of sleep &amp; provokers of tears &amp; heale the
torments of ye belly. But dranck with vinegar they help such as are
bitten by venomous beasts, and the splenitick and such as are troubled
with convulsion fitts, &amp; such as are chilled, &amp; stiff with cold,
&amp; such as let fall their food. But dranck with wine, they bring out
the menses, yea, &amp; the decoction of them is fitting for women’s
fomentations which doe mollify &amp; open the places, &amp; for the
Sciatica being taken by way of infusion, &amp; for Fistulas, &amp; all
hollow sores, which it fills up with flesh. But being applyed as a
Collyrium with hony, they draw out the Embryons. Being fed, &amp; layd
on by way of Cataplasme, they doe mollify the struma &amp; the old
Scirrhus, but being dryed they fill up ulcers, &amp; cleanse them, &amp;
with hony they fill up with flesh the bare of the bones. They are good
also for the head-ache being layd on by way of cataplasme with acetum
&amp; Rosaceum: being dawbed on also with white Veratrum, &amp; twice
soe much hony, they cleanse off the Lentigo, &amp; sun burning; they are
mixt also with the Pessi, with ye Malagmata &amp; with the Acopi, &amp;
in generall they are of very much use.</p>

tillowed places, as also in marishie. But that is ye best [roote] which
is heaviest, thick, full, hard to breake, rough, with a certaine
sharpeness, but such as this is ye Cilician &amp; the Syrian, and that
from the Cycladean Islands. There is a warming power in it, opening ye
narrow mouths of the vasa &amp; it is diureticall, being dranck it helps
such as are troubled with the Calculus, &amp; ye Hydropicall &amp; also
for them that are a scorpione morsi, &amp; it is good for the

ulcera oris, yea although they be feeding [or fretting], being dryed
&amp; beaten to powder. It is mixed also with ye malagmata calfacientia,

<p id="p-85">There are two kindes of Nardus. For the one is called Indian, the
other Syrian: not that it is found in Syria, but because one part of ye
mountaine whereon it growes turnes towards Syria, &amp; the other
towards the Indians. And of that which is called
Syrian,<note n="5" id="ftn-7"/> that is the best which
is new, smooth, full of haire, of a yellow color, very odoriferous,
&amp; besydes that it doth resemble Cyperus in ye smell, it hath a short
eare, it is of a bitter tast, &amp; much drying of ye tongue, continuing
a long tyme in its sweet smell. Of the Indian one kinde is that which is
called Gangeticall, from a certain river named Ganges running by the
hill where it growes. Being somewhat weaker in strength because it
commeth out of watry places, &amp; it is higher, &amp; hath more eares
comming out of the same roote, both full of haires, &amp; one wrapt in
ye other, having a poysonous smell. But that which growes more upon the
Hill,<note n="6" id="ftn-8"/> is a great deale the
sweeter, short-eared, resembling Cyperus in the sweetness of its smell,
&amp; having other qualities in it, such as that hath which is surnamed
the Syrian Nardus. There is also another kinde of Nardus called
Samphariticall from the name of the place, very little, yet great eared,
having a white stalke, growing somme tymes in the middle, in scent, too
much like to ye smell of a goate. This ought utterly to be refused: it
is sold also infused, which fault is found out heereby, that the eare
thereof is white, withered, &amp; having downe on it. They doe
adulterate it by blowing of Stibium with water or wine of dates into it,
for to make it ye more close, &amp; that it may be heavier. When you are
now to use it, if any dirt stick to ye roots thereof, you are to take it
off, &amp; to sift it, separating ye dust thereof which is good to make
a washing water for the handes. They have a warming, drying &amp;
ureticall facultie, whence they both stop ye Alvum being dranck, &amp;
being layd to, they stay ye fluxes of ye wombe &amp; ye whites. But,
being dranck with cold water they help both the Nauseas, &amp; the
Stomachi rosiones &amp; ye troubled with flatuosities &amp; with the
morbus hepaticus, &amp; with the morbus regius, &amp; with the dolor
renum; but sod in water, either by fomentation or by Insessus, they
heale the Inflammatio Vuluae; they are good also for the superflous
humors of the lids of the eyes, binding, &amp; thickning the eye-lids.
And for moyst bodies the inspersion of them [is profitable to take away
the smell of ye sweat]. They are mixed also with Antidots; being ground
smooth, &amp; made into balls with wine they are layd up for eye

<p id="p-87">The Celtick Nard growes on the Alpes of Liguria, in that
countrie-tongue called Gallica. It growes also in Istria. It is but a
little shrub [&amp; short] which is gathered together with ye roots
&amp; made up into hand bundles. It hath sommewhat long leaves of a pale
yellow, with an yellow flower. The use and ye sweetnesse of the smell is
only of the stalkes &amp; roots. Wherefore you ought, (having ye day
before sprinckled the bonds with water) &amp; taken off the earthly
stuffe [about them] to lay them in a more moyst ground, having first
layd paper under them &amp; the next day to make them cleane againe, for
that which is good in it is not taken away by the strength of the
moisture, together with the chaffie &amp; strange stuff. This Herb is
often counterfaited by another herb like it gathered together with it,
which for the poysonous smell that it hath, they call the goate, but the
difference [between these twoe] is easy to be known, for this herb is
without stalke and whiter, &amp; hath lesse long leaves, neither hath it
a bitter, or sweet smelling roote, as in the true Nardus. Chusing
therefore the little stalkes, &amp; ye roots, but casting away the
leaves, but if you will lay them up you must first have them ground
smooth [or small] &amp; mixt with wine, &amp; having made them into
little balls, keep them in a new fictile vas, stopping them carefully.
That is best which is new, &amp; odoriferous, full of roots, plump, not
easie to be broken. It is good for all thinges that the Syriack is, but
it is more Diureticall &amp; better for Stomach griefs. It helps also
the Inflammations about ye Liver, &amp; the Ictericall, &amp; ye
Inflatio ventriculi, being dranck with the decoction of Wormwood. In
like sort it is good for the Spleen, for the Bladder, &amp; for the
Reines; as also mixed with wine for the Bitings of Venemous beasts. It
is used also to be put into malagmata &amp; into Potions, &amp; into
warming oyntments.</p>

<p id="p-100">Of Cinnamon there are many kindes, named by severall names, proper to
the countries where they grow, but that is best which they call,
Mosulum, because it doth in a manner bear a similitude to that Cassia
which they call Mosulitis, and of this that which is newest, black in
colour, enclining to an ashie colour in that of wine, with slender
shootes, &amp; smooth, full of continued knotts, exceeding odoriferous.
For most commonly the discerning of that which is best, doth consist in
the proprietie of the sweetness of the smell. For there is found with
that which is the best, &amp; the most special, a smell resembling that
of Rue, or like to Cardamomum &amp; moreover sharp, &amp; biting to ye

first tryall the best casting about a sweet savour, &amp; filling the

There is also a mountaine (Cinnamon) thick, dwarfish, of a very
glittering color. And a third, from Mosul, black, &amp; of a very sweet
savor, shrubbie, and not having many knotts. The fourth kinde is white,
fungosum, puft up to sight, and vile, &amp; brittle, having a great
roote, smelling like Cassia. The fifth sort, bites the nose with the
smell, is fulvescens, &amp; [in the barck,] very like to red Cassia; but
to the touch it is solid, not very nervosus having a thick roote. Of
these, that which smells of Franckincense, Cassia or Amonum is the worst
in smell. Chuse that which is white, rough, and of a rugged barck: but
pass by that, which is smooth &amp; woody about ye roote, as
unprofitable. And there is another thinge sommewhat like it, which is
called bastard Cinnamon, vile, of a faint smell &amp; of as weake a
strength. And it is also called Ginger being Xylocinnamomum having yet
somme likenesse to Cinnamon. There is also woody Cinnamon that hath
long, &amp; strong shoots, but much inferior (to Cinnamon) for the
sweetnesse of the smell. It is sayd of somme also, that this
Xylocinnamomum, doth differ also in kinde from Cinnamon, as being of
another nature. Now all Cinnamon hath a warming, ureticall, mollifying,
&amp; concocting facultie. It drives out also the menstrua, &amp; the
foetus, being drancke with myrrh, or else layd to. It is good also
against beasts that cast out their poyson &amp; against deadly poysons,
&amp; it doth cleanse away, heate &amp; attenuate the matters that did
darken the apples of ye eyes, and it is Diureticall, &amp; being
anointed on with hony it takes away the Lentigo, and the Sunburning. It

<hi rend="bold">Balsamodendron Opobalsamum</hi></p>
<p id="p-111">Balsamum, the tree, is seen according with the bignesse of Lycium, or
Pyracantha, having leaves like to Rue, but whiter a great deale, &amp;
ever more flourishing. It growes only in Judaea in a certaine vallie,
&amp; in Egypt. Itself differing from itself in ruggednesse, &amp;
tallnesse, &amp; slendernesse, that [part] of the shrub which is thinne
&amp; hairie, is called Theriston, it may be because it is easily mowed
by reason of the slendernesse of it: but that which is called
Opobalsamum, is that juyce which is got, the tree beeing cut with iron
nailes in the heat of ye Dog dayes. But it drops soe little, that at
everie yeare they can get no more but six or seven
Congii<note n="11" id="ftn-13"/> of it, &amp; a weight
of it is sold in that place for double the weight in silver. But that
juyce is good which is new, of a strong smell, &amp; pure, &amp; not
enclining to sweetnesse, dilui facilis, smooth, astringent, and a little
biting the tongue. But it is sophisticated divers waies, for there are
somme that mix oyntments with it, as ye Terebinthinum, Cyprinum,
Lentiscinum, Susinum or Liliaceum, Balaninum, and Metopium, Hony,
Ceratum Myrtinum, or Cyprinum valde liquidum. But such as this is easily
discerned, for the unmixt being let fall upon a woolen cloth, &amp; that
afterward washed out, it makes noe staine nor spot upon it, but that
which is counterfaited, sticks. Againe the pure, being put into water or
milk, is easily diffused, &amp; turnes like milke, but that which is
counterfaited swimmes on the top like oile, turning round or diffusing
itself like a starre. But in tyme, the pure, also turning thick, prooves
worse than itself. But they are deceaved which thinke that this which is
pure, being dropt into water, doth goe downe to ye bottome first, &amp;
afterward being easily diffusable, to rise up againe. But the wood which
is called Xylobalsamum, is best liked, which is new, &amp;
slender-stalked, redd, sweet-smelling, sommewhat resembling the smell of
the Opobalsumum. Of the fruit (for there is necessary use of this too)
chuse that which is yellow, full, great, heavy, biting in tast, &amp;
hot in the mouth, sommewhat scenting of the savour of Opobalsamum. There
is brought from the towne Petra a seed like unto
Hypericum,<note n="12" id="ftn-14"/> whereby they
counterfait this fruit which you may know heereby, because that it is
greater, &amp; emptie, of noe strength, of ye savour of pepper. But the
juyce hath most strength as which doth heate most, cleansing away the
thinges that darken the Pupillae, &amp; curing the Perfrictio circa
Vuluam, being applyed with Ceratum Rosaceum, &amp; it expells the
menstrua, &amp; the Secundas, &amp; the Foetus, &amp; it dissolveth
Rigor, being annointed on, &amp; the filthy matter of boyles. It is also
Concoctionem juvans, and Vrinam ciens, being dranck; it is good also for
the difficult breathers and for such as have drank Aconitum, being given
with milke, as also for those that are <hi rend="italic">a
vipera demorsi</hi>. It is mingled also with Acopus, &amp; Malagma,
&amp; Antidotums. And generally, the juyce of the Balsamum hath most
force; next to that, the fruit; but the wood hath the least strength of
all. The fruit being dranck is good for pleuriticall, for the
Peripneumoniall, for the Tussical, for the Sciaticall, for ye
Epilepticall, for the Vertiginous, for Orthopnoeicall, for the
Torminosi, for the difficultas meiendi, for them that are
<hi rend="italic">a vipera demorsi</hi>. It is fitting also
for muliebres suffitus, &amp; being sod for Insessions it opens the
Vulua and drawes out the moisture. The wood hath the same vertues the
fruit hath, but in a lower degree. Being sod in water, &amp; dranck, it
helps ye Cruditas, the Tormina, them that bee
<hi rend="italic">a vipera demorsi</hi>, ye Convulsi, and it
expells the Urine, &amp; with drie Iris it is good for the Vulnera
Capitis. It drawes out also Squamas ossium. Also it is mixed for the

<p id="p-202"><hi rend="bold">62.</hi> SUSINON. Oil of Lilies</p>
<p id="p-203">Susinum, which somme call [Lirinum], or Liliaceum, is thus made.
After you have mixed together 9 libras 5 ownces of oyle, [of Calamus 5
libras 3 ownces], of Myrrhe 5 ownces, in odoriferous wine, seeth it,
then letting the oyle runne through a strayner, pour it out againe,
&amp; put unto it 3 libras 6 ownces of Cardamomum, bruised &amp;
macerated in raine water, &amp; having suffered it to be sufficiently
macerated together, then straine it out. Then taking three libras &amp;
an half of the thickened oyle, a thowsand in number of Lillies, having
stripped off their leaves, put them in a broade, but not deep vessell,
&amp; pouring in the oyle, stirre it about, with ye handes being
anointed with hony, &amp; soe letting them stand for a day &amp; a
night, the next morning putting it into a Pyxis strainer, but presently
(when it is strained) sever ye oyle a top from ye water that is strained
out with it, for it will not suffer ye water with it, as Rosaceum will,
but being heated together, it growes hot againe, and is corrupted. Pour
it out againe often into other vessells besmeared with Hony, first
sprinckling small salt therein, &amp; taking away the filth thereof
carefully as it gathers together. Then taking ye strained aromatical
stuff out of the baskett, &amp; putting it into a broad vessell, pour in
thereupon againe the like quantitie of ye aromatized oyle as at first,
&amp; cast in together with it 10 drachmas of Cardamom contusi, &amp;
having stirred it well about with ye handes, &amp; staying a little,
straine it out, taking off ye filth from that which runs out. Then
pouring on the oyle againe a third time, doe the like againe casting in
with the Cardamomum &amp; the salt, &amp; pressing it out, besmearing ye
handes with Hony. That which was ye first strained out will be the best,
the second, the next after that, and the third the last. Then taking
againe a thousand Lillies, &amp; stripping off their leaves, lay them in
order, &amp; pour in upon them the oyle which was first strained out.
Worke methodically, doing the same thinges over againe as you did at
first, mingling Cardamomum [as before, &amp; afterward straining it
out.] Doe the same the second, &amp; ye third tyme (as it is sayd)
putting to it the Cardamomum, &amp; afterward straine it out, &amp; doe
the other thinges in like sort. But by how much the oftener you shall
macerate fresh Lillies therein, (by so much) you shall have ye ointment
the stronger. Finally, when it seems unto you that you have enough, mixe
with everie preparation 72 drachmas of the best Myrrhe, 10 drachmes of
Crocus, 75 drachmes of Cinnamon. Somme taking the like quantity of
Crocus, &amp; Cinnamon, having beaten &amp; sifted it, cast it into a
vessell with water, &amp; pour in upon it the ointment of the first
expression: afterward letting it alone a little while, put it into
little dry vessells first besmeared about with gumme, or Myrrhe, and
with saffron, &amp; hony diluted with water. Doe the very same thinges
in the second, &amp; third expression. Somme againe make it with nothing
else but of oleum Balaninum or somme other oyle, &amp; the Lillies. That
is thought to excell most which is made in Phoenicia &amp; in Egypt, the
best of which is that which smells of ye Lillies. It hath a warming,
mollifying, opening facultie, of the praeclusiones &amp; Inflammationes
circa vulvam, [and in generall it is the most profitable of all thinges
ad muliebria mala. It is good also for the Achora, for the Vari, for the
Furfures, &amp; for the Feruidae eruptiones. It doth quickly also alter
the Vibices, and makes them to be of ye same colour (as ye rest of the
skinne). And generally it is of very rarifying nature. Being dranck also
it expells choler per alvum, &amp; it moves urine; but it is hurtfull
for the Stomach, &amp; breeds a nauseousnesse.</p>

Crocus, and this is fitt for medicinall use; and the next best is that
which smells of the Myrrhe. It hath a warming soporiferous facultie,
whence it is that it is often good for the phreneticall, being moystened

like to Myrrhe, but there is but little that growes of this. They doe
counterfeit it by the powder of ye same tree, which is made by the

ye loosenesse that commes of them is easily stopt: they call out ye
Papulae, &amp; ye sweat, they quench the thirst, &amp; are extinguishers

ill-coloured by a long sicknesse, &amp; for ye Asthmaticall, &amp; for
the Epilepticall, &amp; for the Hydropicall. Being sod with Hysop, &amp;

good also for old coughes, &amp; for ye long continued griefs about ye
lunges, &amp; they soften the belly, being beaten together with Nitre,
and Cnicus, &amp; soe eaten. But the decoction of them is good for ye
inflammations about ye Arterie and the Tonsillae, being taken in a
Gargarisme &amp; it is mixed also in Cataplasmes of barly meale, &amp;
for women’s fomentations with Foenigreec, or Ptissana; but being sod
with Rue, it is a glister for ye Tormina. Being sod, and afterward
beaten small, &amp; soe applyed, they dissolve hardnesses, mollify the
Parotidae &amp; ye Furunculi. They ripen the Pani, &amp; ye more
effectually with Iris, or Niter, or Calx viva. And being beaten when
they are raw with the thinges forespecified, they doe ye same. With a
pommegranat rinde it cleanseth away the Pterygia, and with Calcanthum it
cures the hardly curable &amp; malignant fluxes in ye Tibiae. Being sod
in wine &amp; mixed with wormewood, &amp; barly meale soe are they good
for the Hydropicall being layd on as a Cataplasme. But being burnt, and
put into a Cerat, they cure the Perniones. The raw ones being beaten
small, &amp; taken with moist mustard, &amp; put into ye eares, doe cure
ye noyse &amp; ringing of them. The (milkie) juice both of ye wilde

doth dissolve ye same being coagulated, as Vinegar doth. It hath a
qualitie of making bodyes breake out into boiles, and of opening ye
pores, &amp; of loosening ye belly, &amp; of relaxating ye wombe, being
dranck with almonds beaten small. It expells the Menses, being applyed
with ye yolks of an egge, or Tyrrhenicall wax. It is good to be put into
Cataplasmes made for ye Gout, together with Foengraec flower &amp;
vinegar. With Polenta, it doth cleanse Leprosies &amp; ye Lichenas &amp;
the spots made by ye heate of the sunne, and ye vitiligines, and the
Psoras, and the running sores of the head. Being dropt upon the sore, it
helps such as have been stung of Scoprions &amp; ye stroakes by
poysonous beasts, and such as have been bitten of doggs. It helps ye

it takes away the formicosam verrucam, the flesh round about it being

feed on binding food, on ye oake &amp; Lentisck, &amp; the leaves of the

But sheep’s milke is both thick &amp; sweet &amp; very fatt, but not soe

&amp; taken away ye filth that stuck in ye bottomme, &amp; having melted
it &amp; having strained it, set it up &amp; use it. After the same
manner is that which was prepared before, made to smell sweet.</p>
<p id="p-724">The aforesayd fatts are thus first thickned, that they may the more

a new vessell, and pouring in old odoriferous white wine, that it may
exceed 8 fingers in depth, seeth them together, using a slack fire, till

all its strong greasie smell, having strained it, let it coole. And
taking of bruised Aspalathus one pounde, &amp; of the flowers of

receaved all the strength &amp; smell of ye thicknings, having taken it
downe &amp; strayned it, melt it, &amp; soe set it up. But if you would
make it to smell sweeter, mix heerewithall eight dragms of ye fattest
Myrrhe, diluted in wine of many yeares standing.</p>
<p id="p-726">But poultries or goose grease is made to have a sweet scent after

then lay thereupon one by one hott pills of goates dung, till the sense

rhoeas, of which wee will speake when wee comme to discourse of Poppies,
from the wilde Anenome, because of the likenesse of the colour of the

Eupatorium. Yet the Phoenician colour of ye Argemone is sommewhat lesse
deep, as also of the Rhoeas, and both it &amp; Argemone doe flower
later. And the Argemone doth yield a juice of a Saffron colour, &amp;
extreme sharpe to the tast, but ye Rhoeas a whiter juice, &amp; sharpe.
But both of them have little heads between, like the wilde Poppie, but
that of Argemone is sommewhat broader at the toppe, &amp; that of Rhoeas
sommewhat narrower. But the Anemones doe neither give out any juice,
neither have they an head or cup, but as it were the top of Asparagus,

Aegyptians Sophoeth, ye Sicilians Chamaemelum, ye Italians terrae malum,

&amp; level places or else in rough and rocky places. It is good for a

with ye seed of Dracunculus &amp; honey it helps the Carcinomata in ye

but ye Carcomata, &amp; ye Polypi being anointed on for some days
together with Coblers ink, or Aerugo, but pull off extuberancies with a

it is adulterated with Sarcocolla &amp; glue mixed together. But choose
that which is transparent &amp; sharp, but that which is taken by ye

burning doth remain for a long time, so that whatsoever is brought them
seems to be Euphorbium. But ye first finding of it is known to be when
Juba was king of Lybia. But ye juice hath a faculty of dissolving
suffusions, being anointed on, but being drank it burns one through a

ye proportion of ye sharpness. It is good also for griefs of ye hips,
being mixed with an aromaticall potion, &amp; so drank. It doth away
scales from ye bones the self-same day, but it behoves them that use it
to secure the flesh lying about the bones with linen cloths or Cerats.
But some give out that no hurt doth follow upon them that are
serpent-bitten, if one having cut ye skin of ye head even unto the bone,

faint in ye smell and rougher, but that of Gum is without strength &amp;

Erasistratus saith that Diagoras doth disallow the use of it for such as

beating it in a mortar make it into Trochiscks, &amp; such as this is

is of them. But used too much they make men speechless. The seed of the

gathered into a concavity; but ye juice is more effectual than ye
liquor. But ye roots do not bear liquor in every place: experience doth
show as much. They give out also that there is another sort called
Morion, growing in shady places, &amp; about dens, having leaves like to
ye white Mandrake, but less, as it were a span long, white, lying round
about ye root, it being tender, &amp; white, by a little longer than a

Phlegm, and choler. But the purging by it, is best for hard-breathers,
if therefore you would purge the belly downward, mixing twice as much of
salt, &amp; stibium as much as to colour it, give pills as big as Ervum
formed with water, &amp; let him sup them with one Cyathus of lukewarm
water. But for vomiting, diluting (ye Elaterium) in water, anoint with a
feather ye places under ye tongue, as far in as may be; but if he be
hard to vomit, diluting it either in oil or with unguentum Irinum, but
forbid him to sleep. But to those which are overpurged you must give
with a continuance oiled wine for so ye vomiters are restored. But if ye
vomitings do not cease cold water must be given, and Polenta, and Posca,
&amp; an apple, &amp; as many things as can thicken ye stomach. And
Elaterium also in a Pessum doth move ye menstrua &amp; kill ye Embrya.
And being poured in with milk unto ye nostrils, it cleanseth away ye

<p id="p-1971">Thapsia [which some call Hypopion, some Pancranon, some Scammonion,
some Thelyteris, the Romans Ferulago, some Ferula sylvestris, ye
Africans Boide] is so-called, because it is thought first to be found in
Thapsus an Island of ye like name. But in ye whole nature of it is like
to Ferula, but ye stalk of it is more slender, and ye leaves like to
Fennill, but on ye top at every breaking out are tufts like to Dill, on
which is a yellowish flower. The seed somewhat broad, like to that of
Ferula, yet less. The root within white, great, but without black, thick
barked, sharp, which hath its liquor taken by being digged about &amp;
having ye bark cut in. Or ye root itself, being made hollow in itself,
like an house roof broad beneath &amp; narrow at last, &amp; being
stopped that the liquor may remain pure. Then the next day after, they
must, going thither, take away ye liquor that is gathered together. But
it is juiced, ye root being beaten, and strained through a wicker
Colander, &amp; a Press &amp; dried in ye sun with a thick earten
vessel. And some also bruise with it ye leaves, but such as this, is
weak. But the juice of ye root is discerned by being of a stronger
scent, &amp; by remaining moist, but that of ye leaves by being dry,
&amp; being worm-eaten. But it behoves him that takes ye liquor not to
stand against ye wind, but rather to doe it in still weather. For it
puffs up ye face mightily, &amp; ye naked parts are blistered by the
sharpness of ye exhalations. He ought therefore, first to anoint ye
nakedness of ye parts with moist binding Cerats, &amp; so to come to it.
But both the bark of ye root, &amp; ye juice &amp; ye liquor have a
purging faculty, being drank with Melicrat, for they purge choler upward
&amp; downward. But there is given 4 Oboli of ye root with 3 dragms of
ye seed of Dill, but of the juice 3 Oboli, and of ye liquor, an Obolus,
for more being given is dangerous. But ye purging by it, is good for
Asthmaticall griefs, for long continued pains of ye sides, &amp; for
expectorations, but to such as are hard to vomit it is given in meats
&amp; sauces. And both ye liquor &amp; ye root of all, especially those
of equal strength, do possess a Metasyncriticall faculty, whether we
ought to draw out anything from far within, or to alter ye state of ye
pores, whence ye juice being anointed on, or ye green root rubbed on
doth thicken ye Alopeciae. And ye root beaten small, or the juice with
franckincense &amp; wax of each alike, takes away both sugillata and
liventia. But it must be let lie no longer than 2 hours, and after this
to foment ye place with warm sea-water. It takes away also sun-burnings
being smeared on with honey, &amp; removes leprosies. And the juice
breaks also Tubercula being anointed on with sulphur. And it is anointed
also profitably upon such as have long lasting griefs about the side, or
the lungs, or the feet, or ye joint. It is of good use also for reducing
ye Preputia, on such as want ye foreskin, so it be not by Circumcision,
raising up a tumor, which being fomented and softened with fat things
doth fill up ye defect of ye Preputium.</p>

But with Melicrate also it moves vomitings. It is juiced about the time
of vintage, ye rods being laid together, and so cut. But they must be
shut up in a vessel. But some mixing meal of Ervum form pills thereof of
ye bigness of Ervum. And some do drop 3 or 4 drops into dried figs, and
drying them set them up. But being beaten of itself in a mortar it is
formed into pills, &amp; set up. But in the juicing one must not stand
against ye wind, nor put his hands to his eyes, but also before the
juicing he must anoint his body with grease, or oil with wine, and
especially ye face, &amp; ye neck, &amp; ye Scrotum. But it exasperates
also ye sharp Artery, whence he ought to wrap ye pills in wax, or sodden
honey, &amp; soe to give it. But two or 3 dry figs being taken are
sufficient for a purge. Ye juice newly made also being smeared on with
oil in ye Sun, takes off hair, &amp; makes those which come up again
yellow and thin, &amp; in ye end destroys them all. It is put also into
ye concavities of teeth, mitigating the pains. But you must cover ye
teeth about with wax, so that running beside, it does not hurt ye sharp
artery, or the tongue. It takes away also ye Myrmeciae, &amp; hanging

for ye Pterygia, &amp; Carbuncles, Phagedenas, Gangrenes, Fistulas. And

<p id="p-2092">Those Wines, which are old, are hurters of ye nerves and of the rest
of ye senses, yet are they pleasant to ye taste. Wherefore it is to be
avoided by those who have any part weake within. Yet for the use of it
in health, both a little is taken without hurt, &amp; that diluted in
water. But new wine is inflative, hard of digestion, breeding grievous
dreams, ureticall. But that which is of a middle age doth avoid either
of these evils, wherefore it is to be chosen in ye uses both of health
&amp; sickness.</p>
<p id="p-2093"><hi rend="bold">8.</hi> The Colour of Wine</p>
<p id="p-2094">Further, white wine is both thin and soon digested &amp; good for ye
stomach. But ye black is thick &amp; hard to digest, heady, and breeding
of flesh. But ye Claret being of a middle colour, hath also a midling
force to either of these, yet the white is to be chosen both in health,
&amp; in sickness. And moreover they differ in respect of ye
quality.</p>
<p id="p-2095"><hi rend="bold">9.</hi> The Flavours of Wines and their
Properties</p>
<p id="p-2096">For the sweet wine doth consist of gross parts &amp; is hard to
evaporate, very much puffing up of ye stomach &amp; disturbing of ye
belly &amp; ye entrailes, like as the must; yet it doth less inebriate
&amp; is convenient for ye bladder &amp; ye kidnies; but ye sharp wine
is more ureticall, &amp; a causer both of headache and drunkenness. But
ye unripe wine is most fitting for ye digesting of meats, &amp; it is a
stopper of ye belly &amp; of other fluxes, but that which is mild doth
less touch the sinewy parts, &amp; it is less ureticall. But that made
with sea-water is bad for ye stomach, causing thirst, hurting the
sinnewes yet good for ye belly, unfitting for such as are late recovered
of a sickness. But that Passum which is made of ye sun-dried grape, or
dried on the branches, &amp; prest called Creticum, or Protropum, or
Pramnium, and that of Must sodden, called Sirion or Hepsema, that which
is black called Melampsithion is thick, &amp; much nourishing, but ye
white is thinner, and that in ye midst hath also a midling faculty. But
all are Binding, recalling ye pulse. Being good against all poisons,
which kill with exulcerating, when drank with oil, &amp; vomited up
again: &amp; against Meconium &amp; Pharicum, &amp; Toxicum, &amp;
Hemlock &amp; milk curdled in ye stomach, &amp; against ye griefs of ye
bladder and kidnies, being corroded &amp; exulcerated: but they are
windy, &amp; bad for ye stomach. But that called Melampsithium is
properly good for such as have a fluxing belly. But ye white is more
mollifying of ye belly than ye other. But that which hath Gypsum, is
offensive to ye sinews, causeth ye Gravedinem capitis, is burning &amp;
naught for ye bladder: it is better than the other against poisons. But
wines which have pitch, or Rosin of the Pine, are warming &amp;
digestive, yet hurtful for blood-spitters; but they which are called
Aparachyta, having yet Sapa mixed with them, are fillers of ye head,
begetters of drunkenness, hard to evaporate, naught for ye stomach.</p>
<p id="p-2097"><hi rend="bold">10.</hi> Wines of different countries</p>
<p id="p-2098">But that of ye wines in Italy, which seems to excell, is called
Falernum, which being old is soon digested, recalling the Pulse, binding
ye belly, &amp; good for ye stomach, but bad for ye bladder, &amp;
unfitting for ye dull-sighted, and for to be much drank of. But ye
Albanian is of thicker parts than ye Falernian, sweetish, puffing up the
stomach, mollifying the belly, &amp; not working alike upon ye
digestion, but less huring of ye sinewy part, and this also when it is
old grows hard. Ye Caecubum being sweet, is of thicker parts than ye
Albanian, &amp; a breeder of flesh, &amp; of a good colour, but bad for
digestion. But Surrentinum is very hard, wherefore it stays ye flux of
ye entrailes, &amp; of ye stomach, &amp; it toucheth ye head less, being
of light parts, but when old it is good for ye stomach, &amp; becomes
more pleasant. Ye Adrianum &amp; ye Mamertianum growing in Sicily are
both alike of thick parts indifferently binding, &amp; they grow old
quickly, &amp; they touch ye sinewy part less because of mildness that
is in them. And ye Praepianum,<note n="97" id="ftn-106"/>
which is brought out of ye places about Adria, is of a sweet scent and
milder, but being much drank of, it lies not hid, but keeps drunkenness
for a long time, &amp; brings a sleep. That which is called Istricum is
like to ye Praepianum, being more ureticall. But ye Chium is more gentle
than ye aforesaid, well-nourshing, potable, less making drunk, staying a
flux, usefull to be put in eye medicines. But ye Lesbian is easily
digested, being lighter than ye Chian, &amp; good for ye belly. But that
which grows by Ephesus, &amp; is called Phygelites doth obtain the same
virtue to this, but that of Asia called Messogites from ye mountain
Tmolus breeds ye headache &amp; hurts ye sinews. But ye Coon, &amp;
Clazomenian because they partake of much sea-water, are soon corrupted,
are inflative, are disturbers of ye belly, &amp; hurters of ye
sinews.</p>
<p id="p-2099"><hi rend="bold">11.</hi> The Effects of Wines</p>
<p id="p-2100">But generally all unmixed &amp; simple wines, hard by nature, is
warming, easily digested, good for ye stomach, wetting ye appetite,
nourishing, soporiferous, inducing a good colour, but being drunk
liberally, it helps those which have taken hemlock, or Coriander, or
Pharicum, or Ixia, or Meconium or Lithargyrum, or Smilax, or Aconitum,
or mushrooms &amp; for ye bitings of serpents, &amp; ye strokes of all
that by striking or biting do kill by cold or overturn ye stomach. And
it is effectuall for ye windiness of long continuance, &amp; ye gnawing
of ye Hypochondrium, and ye distension &amp; singultus stomachi, &amp;
for ye flux of ye entrails, and of ye belly, &amp; it is good for
sweaters &amp; such as faint thereby, but especially ye white &amp; old
&amp; sweet-smelling wines; but the old &amp; sweet are more convenient
both for ye griefs about ye bladder &amp; kidnies, as also for wounds
&amp; inflammations, being laid on with Lana Succida. And they are
fomented on profitably for malignant and phagedoenicall and running
ulcers. And for use in time of health, those without sea-water, hard and
white are fitting. Of these ye Italian vines do excell, as ye Falernum,
Surrentinum, &amp; Caecubum, &amp; the Signenan, &amp; many others which
are of Campania, &amp; the Praepian from ye Adriaticall coast, &amp; ye
Sicilian which is called Mamertinum: and of ye Greek wines, ye Chian,
Lesbian &amp; ye Phygelites that grows in Ephesus. But the thick black
wines are bad for ye stomach, inflative, yet breeding flesh: but the
thinner and hard are good for ye stomach, and less breeding flesh; but
those which are very old &amp; thin &amp; white, are more ureticall, yet
being drank too much, they touch ye sinewy part; but wines of a middle
age are best for drinking, as those from seven years. But ye quantity
must be ordered by the age, &amp; the time of ye year, &amp; ye custom
of ye drinker &amp; ye quality of ye wine. Ye best rule is not to be
athirst, &amp; moderately to steep the meat, for all drunkenness &amp;
especially that which is continual is pernicious. For ye sinews being
besieged day by day (at last) yield, &amp; ye too much drinking every
day, makes an entrance of sharp griefs. But to be drunk moderately for
some days, &amp; especially after water-drinking is profitable. For it
alters ye state of a man in a manner, purging the vapors that annoy ye
senses, &amp; opening ye passages secretly. Yet after this drinking of
wine you must drink water, for it brings a manner of help for ye
avoiding of some malady owing to the drunkenness that lies upon one.</p>

<p id="p-2250">The best of ye Cadmia is ye Cyprian which is called Botryites, thick,
heavy indifferently, but rather inclining to lightness, having an
outside like Clusters, in colour like ashes, but being broken, ashie and
rusty within. But ye next is of an azure colour without, but whiter
within, having vains like to an Onyx Stone, for such as these are they
which are digged out of old mines. And there is a sort called Placodes,
having vains (or strokes) like guirdles, whence also they did call it
Zonitis. And there is a sort called Ostracitis, slender, &amp; as for ye
most part black, endued with an earthy or testacean out-side, but ye
white is naught. But that which is called Botryitis &amp; Onychitis is
of good use for eye-medicines and ye rest for plasters, and dry
medicines, which are of force to cicatrize. And for these things ye
Cyprian is of best use. For that which is brought out of Macedonia and
Thracia and Spain is unprofitable. But it hath a binding faculty filling
up ye hollowness of sores, &amp; cleansing their foulness. And stops ye
passage of ye pores, and drys, and draws to a scab, &amp; represseth
excrescencies of ye flesh, &amp; cicatriseth ye malignancies of ulcers.
But Cadmia also comes from brass red-hot in a furnace, the soot sticking
to the sides, &amp; to ye top of the furnaces. Now [rods] of iron, of a
great bigness, called by ye metal-men Acestides are joined together at
ye top to ye end that ye bodies that are carried up from the brass, may
be held &amp; settled there; which also sticking ye more, grow into a
body, &amp; sometime one kind of it, sometimes two, or all are made. It
is made also of a burned stone called Purites, digged out of an hill
that lies over Solis. And in ye same mount are found (as it were) some
vaines of Chalcitis, Misy, Sory, Melanteria,
Coeruleus,<note n="101" id="ftn-110"/> Chrysocolla,
Calcanthus, Diphryges. And some also say that Cadmia is found in metals
growing in stones, being deceived by ye stones having great resemblance,
as in the case of a stone found at Cumae, showing no strength. They are
known by their being lighter than Cadmia, &amp; that being chewed, they
are not mild in the taste, but do offend the teeth if ye stone were in
ye chewing, but if it were Cadmia it would abide ye eating, it being of
an yielding nature. And it is hereby discerned, that Cadmia being beaten
small, &amp; tempered with vinegar, and dried in the sun comes together,
but that the stone doth not suffer this. Also that ye stone being broken
&amp; put into fire, doth leap, &amp; that ye smoke that comes of it is
like unto ye fire; but ye Cadmia both remains quiet and yieldeth a smoke
of a yellowish &amp; brass-like colour as a girdle with divers colours.
And further ye stone, being burnt &amp; cooled again, shall be altered
in ye colour and shall be lighter, but the Cadmia alters in no respect,
except one shall burn it for many days. It is made also out of ye
furnaces for Silver, being whiter and lighter, but lesser, as concerning
ye operation. But they burn ye aforesaid Cadmia covering it in coals,
until it becomes transparent, &amp; casts out flaming sparks, as plates
of Iron do, then it must be quenched in Aminaean wine; but that which is
for Psoricall medicines, in Acetum. But some beating small again this
which was so burnt, mix it with wine &amp; burn it again in a raw
earthen vessel, until it be made to look like a Pumex. And again beating
it small &amp; mixing it with wine, they burn it ye third time, till it
be resolved perfectly into ashes, having no roughness, &amp; they use
such as this instead of Spodium. It is washed by being beaten with water
in a mortar, ye water being poured away until no filth be standing upon
it; &amp; then being made into balls, it is set up.</p>

<p id="p-2251"><hi rend="bold">85.</hi> POMPHOLUX. Pompholyx: a deposit
in smelting furnaces</p>
<p id="p-2252">Pompholyx doth differ from Spodium specifically, for it hath not a
genericall difference, for ye Spodos is somewhat black &amp; for ye most
part heavier, being full of motes and hairs and earth, being as it were
ye scraping &amp; shaving of ye floors &amp; hearths in the
brass-finers’ shops. But Pompholix is fatt &amp; white, &amp; withall
most light, so that it can fly into the air. Of this there are two
kinds, one of ye colour of ye air, &amp; somewhat fat, but the other
very white, and having ye heighth of lightness. But ye white becomes
Pompholix when in ye working and finishing of ye brass, ye brass-finers
do sprinkle on ye bruised Cadmia the thicker, willing to have it ye
better; for ye smoke that is carried up from this, being most white, is
turn’d into Pompholyx. But Pompholyx is not made only from ye working
and matter of brass, but also from Cadmia purposely blown with ye
bellows for ye making of it. And it is made thus. In an house having a
double roof a chimney is built, and by it towards ye loft, a suitable
window, and open at ye parts above. But ye wall of ye house next to ye
chimney, is beaten through with a small hole, into the very furnace for
ye receiving of the bellows. It hath also a proportionable door made for
ye going in, &amp; coming out of the workman. There is joined unto this
room another room, wherein ye bellows &amp; ye bellows-blower work. Then
the coals are put into ye furnace and are kindled, afterward ye workman
standing by doth sprinkle on from the places over the head of ye furnace
the Cadmia being beaten small. And ye servant that is under withall doth
do ye same, &amp; casteth on more coals, until all ye Cadmia that was
laid on be consumed, so that by the burning, the thin &amp; light part
is carried into the upper room, &amp; sticks to the walls &amp; to ye
roof thereof. But the body that is made of those things carried up, at
ye beginning indeed is like to ye bubbles standing upon ye waters, but
at last more increase coming, it is like to fleeces of wool. But that
which is heavier goeth into ye places under foot &amp; is dispersed
about, some to ye furnace, &amp; some to ye floor of ye house. This is
thought to be worse than that of thin parts, because it is earthy &amp;
full of filth by ye gathering of it. And some think that ye aforesaid
Spodos is made only thus. But it is thought that ye Cyprian is ye best
which being wrought into a mass with Acetum, hath the smell of brass,
but ye colour in a manner, pitchy, &amp; further, being like dirt in ye
taste. And being without deceit, if it be put on a burning coal it boils
becoming of an aery colour. But we must look carefully to the signs
afore spoken of, for it is counterfeited with bulls-glue, or with lambs
lungs, or with those of ye sea, or with green figs burnt, &amp; some
other like things. But it is easy to be known, for none of ye aforesaid
tokens in the trial are found upon these. But Pompholyx is commonly
washed after this manner. Having bound it in a clean linen cloth of a
moderate thinness, either dry or made into a mass with water, put it
into a basin having rasin-water, &amp; plunge it therein, carrying ye
knott this way, and that way, so that the slimy matter &amp; that which
is good, will be run out, but all ye refuse stuff will remain in ye
cloth. Then suffering it to be settled, strain out ye water with ye
ashes, &amp; again having poured on other water, roll it about &amp;
then pour it out &amp; do these things, both straining it, and pouring
it out until that no sandy matter do subside. Finally strain out the
water, but having dried ye ashes, set it up. But some drying it as much
as may be, squeeze it in their hands with water, &amp; making it of an
honey-like consistence, they strain it through a linen cloth spreading
it over ye vessel that shall receive it; &amp; eke binding it not too
stiff, but that it may easily pass through, pouring in water in
abundance on ye linen cloth, they trouble ye ashes, then taking up with
a spoon from hence ye strained &amp; ye frothy stuff of it swimming on
ye top, they set it up in a new earthen vessel. But straining gently
that which is settled, they pour it into another vessel, the sandy
matter being left at the bottom. And again suffering ye stony substance
to subside, they strain it into another clean vessel, &amp; this they do
often, until ye ashes become clean, and without sand. But others do wet
it as it is whole in ye water by little, &amp; little, thinking that ye
aforesaid sand &amp; ye stony matter would fall by its own weight to the
bottom of ye vessel, but that ye hair &amp; ye moates and such like
would be lifted on high by their lightness; then severing ye ashes of
them being in the middle, &amp; casting them into a mortar, they wash
them as Cadmia. It is washed also with Chian wine diluted with
sea-water, according to ye aforesaid fashions, &amp; it becomes more
binding than that which is washed with water. But Pompholyx hath a
binding, cooling, filling, purging &amp; something of a drying faculty.
But if need be that Spodium should be roasted, having carefully beaten
it small &amp; sprinkled it with water, make Trochiscks thereof, &amp;
put them in a new earthen vessell. But set this on a small &amp; gentle
coal fire, &amp; turn ye little balls continually, until that they
become red, and dry. It is to be known also that Spodium is made out of
gold, and of silver, &amp; moreover also of lead, and that of lead is ye
best after that of Copper.</p>

<p id="p-2272">And washen lead is prepared after this manner. Casting water into a
leaden mortar, beat it with a leaden pestle until that ye water grow
black &amp; become muddy: then strain it through a linen cloth, pouring
on more water, that all that which is dissolved may be strained; &amp;
do ye same again until it seem unto thee to have enough: then letting
that which is washed settle, pour out that water and pour in other, as
in the case of Cadmia wash until that any blackness no longer stand upon
it. Having made trochiscks thereof, set it up. But some sprinkling water
upon clean lead, beat it in a stony mortar with a stony pestle, or with
ye hands pouring on water by little, &amp; little under hand, when that
which is grown black has been suffered to settle, they pour it out &amp;
form into trochiscks forthwith. For that which is rubbed longer, becomes
like to Cerussa. But some cast in to the dust of ye lead a little
Plumbago, saying that lead so washed is ye better. It is of force to
cool, to bind, to stop ye pores, to fill up hollownesses, to stay the
rhumes that fall into ye eyes, &amp; ye flashy excrescencies of ulcers.
And it is also a blood-stancher, &amp; good for ye ulcers in the seat,
for ye Condylomata and Haemorrhoids with Rosaceum; also for sores hard
to be cicatrized, &amp; in general it doth whatsoever Spodium doth,
without raising a scab. But unmixed lead being rubbed on doth help ye
stroke of ye sea Scorpion, &amp; of ye Dragon.</p>

them into a new pot, &amp; having sprinkled brimstone upon, lay on other

that you shall have filled ye pot: then put fire under. Then the lead
being kindled, stir it with an iron rod till that it be perfectly turned
to ashes, &amp; have nothing leadlike in it; then take it out, having
stopped ye nostrils, for ye vapour is hurtfull, and casting ye dust of
lead with brimstone into a pot, so burn it. But some casting ye plates
(as hath been said) into a raw earthen vessel, put it into a furnace, or
over coals, luting the cover &amp; giving it a little breathing place,
burn it. Some again strew about Cerussa instead of brimstone, or barley.
And some putting in the plates without any mixture, doe use a sharp
fire, and stir it about lustily with an iron rod, until that it turn to
ashes; but such burning as this is difficult, and being burned too much,
so it takes ye colour of Lithargyrum. But the first burning pleaseth me.
But we must was it as the Cadmia, and so set it up. It hath ye faculty

It is washed as ye Cadmia. But it is whited thus. Taking as much as a
Choenix of Athens of that which is called Argyritis, &amp; if not, then
that of ye other, broken into ye bigness of beans, &amp; casting it into

pouring on water wash the Lithargyrum, rubbing it strongly likewise with

having strained out ye water, beaten it again for a whole day, &amp; at

strained out that, pour in more &amp; thus strain it out 3 times a day.
Doe this for seven days: then having mixed to a pound of Lithargyrum 5
dragms of Sal Fossile, and pouring on warm water, beat it 3 times a day,
straining out ye old, &amp; mixing new water. But whether it is become
white, pouring on warm water, do ye same until it have a shew of no
saltness; &amp; having dried it in a most sharp sun, casting away first
the moisture, set it up: &amp; if not take one pound of Argyritis, beat
it small carefully, &amp; having beaten it, mix of mineral salt beaten
small 3 times as much, and cast it into a new earthen vessel, &amp;
casting on water so that it may stand above, stirr it every day, morning
&amp; evening pouring in thereto more water, pouring out none of the
former; and do this for 30 days, for being not stirred, it grows hard as

small ye Lithargyrum in a Thebaicall mortar &amp; casting it into an
earthen vessel &amp; pouring on water stirr it diligently with thine
hands, pouring out ye first, and pouring on ye other, until it have no
appearance of saltness. Then having poured out ye white of ye
Lithargyrum into another vessel, make Trochiscks thereof, &amp; set them
up in a leaden box. But some, breaking the Lythargyrum into ye bigness
of beans &amp; putting it into ye raw belly of a swine, seeth it in

beating it with as much salt, they washed it as is aforesaid. And some
do pound in ye sun one pound of salt, &amp; as much of Lithargyrum, with

Taking as much as you will, of Lithargyrum &amp; having wrapt it in

ye Lithargyrum, &amp; wrapping it in other wool and seeth it ye second
time, purring thereto a Cyathus of water and the like quantity of beans,
&amp; doe ye same things like to ye aforesaid ye third time, &amp; in
brief until ye wool take no more tincture. And after this changing it
into a mortar, to 80 Attick dragms of Lithargyrum, mix one pound of
mineral salt, &amp; beat it small. Then staying awhile, add, of ye very
whitest Nitre washed with water 47 dragms, &amp; beate it again until
that ye Lithargyrum be sufficiently white. And so having poured it from

store of water, &amp; letting it settle, strain it. And interchangeably
doe after ye aforesaid directions until ye water that runs over become
very clear &amp; sweet, &amp; unpartaking of saltness. And after all
having changed it into a new earthen platter, all the moisture being
gently strained out, set it in the sun 40 days under ye Dog, &amp;

upon the mouth of ye earthen vessell, a little reeden mat being laid
under before; &amp; on ye top of it cast coverings to ye end that ye

distilling, and strain out ye pure liquor which is elevated, but ye

and sarced, &amp; after this ye rest of that which is hard to be made

fastening it toward ye middle of ye vessel, so that it may (as it were)

let it alone. And after some days taking off the cover they look in
&amp; when it is dissolved they do ye other things like the aforesaid.
But if any will form it into Trochiscks, it must be kneaded with sharp

aforespoken must be done in ye summer, for so it becomes white and

<p id="p-2312">That Calcitis is to be preferred, which looks like brass &amp; is
brittle being without stones, &amp; not old, &amp; moreover having
somewhat long and glittering vains. But it hath both a binding &amp; a
warming &amp; an incrustating faculty, purging away of ye filth about ye
eye-corners, and ye eyes; and it is of those things that do
indifferently bind. And it is good also for ye Erysipelata, &amp; the
Herpetas, &amp; fluxes of blood which come from ye womb, &amp; from ye
nostrils, with ye juice of a Leek. The powder of it is good for
repressing ye gums’ excrescencies, &amp; ye Nomas, &amp; ye Tonsillas;
but being burnt it is far more useful for eye-medicines being beaten
small &amp; mixed with honey, &amp; it abates &amp; cleanseth hard-grown
and rough eye-lids, &amp; it takes away fistulas, being put in like a
Collyrium.</p>

<p id="p-2314">That which is called Psoricum is made of this Calcitis, two parts of
Calcitis being mixed with one of Cadmia, &amp; beaten small with
vinegar. And it must be close shut up in an earthen vessel in dung for
40 days, in those under ye Dog, so it becomes sharper, being good for
whatever Calcitis is. And some mixing them in equal proportions beat
them in wine, &amp; do ye same as before. But they burn it putting it in
a new earthen vessel, and setting it over burning coals. But let this be
ye measure of ye burning in those (metals) which are full of moisture,
to become without bubbles, &amp; to be perfectly dried, &amp; in the
rest, to change into a more flourishing colour. For when it is like
blood or Rubrica deep within, then it is to be taken off, &amp; you are
to blow off the filth that lieth on it, &amp; so to set it up. But it is
roasted on coals that are blown, until it become of a pale yellow, or in
an earthen pot over burning coals, being turned oft, till it be on fire
and change colour.</p>

in the breaking of a golden colour, and glistering like a starr. It hath
ye same faculty &amp; burning that Chalcitis hath, without ye making of
Psoricum from it, differing both in ye excesse &amp; ye defect. But that

And they are good for leprosies with ye leaves of Brassica, or sodden
with honey, &amp; for itches &amp; for rotten nails, &amp; for ye

and moist pitch. And it is a remedy for knits, and lice, and burnings
being anointed on with water. And they are smeared on for ye Oedemata
&amp; for ye rank smells of ye armpits &amp; ye groins. Allom of Melos
also co-operates to inconception, being laid before conjunction to ye

<p id="p-2459">The following identifications of the plants of Dioscorides are those
which were suggested by Professor Charles Daubeny in 1857, and published
as an Appendix to his Lectures on Roman Husbandry wherein he gave the
following explanation:</p>
<p id="p-2460">“Those introduced have been classified according to the Natural
System; in which undertaking I have availed myself of the kind
assistance of Mr. Maxwell Masters, Lecturer on Botany to St. George’s
Hospital, who till lately filled the post of Sub-Curator to the Fielding
Herbarium, now attached to the Botanic Garden at Oxford.</p>
<p id="p-2461">It has been thought useful to point out in what degree, and in what
cases, the conjecture formed as to the plant intended derives
confirmation from the drawings accompanying the most ancient known MS.
of Dioscorides, which has been done, by noticing briefly the character
of the figure therein given. When the term
<hi rend="italic">fictitious</hi> is attached, the meaning
is, that the artist, in ignorance of the plant named, has given a
representation of some other, totally unconnected with the real one, if
indeed he has not in this instance drawn from his own fancy alone. In
other cases, the figure given, however bad, rude, or inaccurate, is
conceived to have been taken, either from the plant itself, or from some
drawing of it to which the draughtsman had had access”</p>
<p id="p-2462">Out of 345 plants he regarded 93 as good, 36 as fictitious, 17 as
bad, 16 with some resemblance, 3 with no resemblance, 127 as pretty
good, 9 as tolerably like, and 44 as indifferent.</p>
